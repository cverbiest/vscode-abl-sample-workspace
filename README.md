# VsCode OpenEdge ABL sample workspace

This repo is an example of a workspace configured for https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cverbiest.abl-developer-pack.

## How to use

Clone this repo and open the abl.code-workspace using vscode, it should prompt you to install the extension pack.

## What is here

This repo contains sample config for the extensions that require extra setup.

I tried to have all configuration inside the git repo, you'll probably want some settings global instead of per workspace.

* Web search : Search OpenEdge docs and Progress related sites
* PCT ant setup, clean and build tasks 
* Launch configs
* File templates for ABL class enum interface procedure
* ABL code snippets
* Replace rules : Remove user info, useful for posting log fragments
